## Why i decided to make a game
I created this game to practice python programming. Since I haven't explored any libraries or frameworks yet, creating a simple game using pygame seemed like a good idea to me. But in the end the game turned out to be more difficult than I expected at the beginning. However, I like what I got.

## Program structure
- **File _sprites.py_** stores the classes of sprites and other game elements (surfaces).
- **File _sqripts.py_** contains classes Game and Level, containing scripts for the interaction of the player with the sprites, and the sprites among themselves. How the game should take place.
- **File _main.py_** is the main one, and contains the logic for changing levels.
